
PUT YOUR NAME HERE: _________David Gottlieb_______________

NOTE: If you are working by yourself (no teammates), then use this file
(self_reflection_1.txt).  If you are working with teammates, then the order
of the names in your team repository determines who uses which of the three
self_reflection_X.txt files, as per this example:
   For team     csse120-202110-andersm3-morrisnc-sheerimm
     -- anderssm3 must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- morrisnc  must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- sheerimm  must use   self_reflection_3.txt
Another example:
   For team     csse120-202101-kintnecm-rams-harristj
     -- kintnecm  must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- rams      must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- harristj  must use   self_reflection_3.txt

Then answer the following questions.
Answers can be BRIEF, but we expect them to be THOUGHTFUL answers.

1.  Explain, in a sentence or two, something that SURPRISED you
    after you began working on your project.

    Both the mechanics behind the gravity and the platform detection surprised me. While the final code for this was done by Vidhu, I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure
    it out myself. I found it especially confusing to work with the x and y coordinates for each sprite, since they start at the top left corner -- my intuition assumes bottom left.

2.  Identify something that you would have done DIFFERENTLY in your project,
    with hindsight.  Then explain, in a short paragraph, how you did that
    something (in your actual project), how you would have done it differently,
    why you would do it differently, and how you would encourage yourself
    to do it (or its equivalent) differently in future projects.

    In terms of working in a group, communication was lacking at the beginning, since we ended up both working on the enemy class at the same time. This meant time that could
    have been spent on another tasks was wasted. Next time I'd make it clear what we were working on individually, and if I got stuck I'd ask for a second pair of eyes to look
    at my code. In terms of the actual coding of the game, I would look at the pygame commands to figure out if I need to hard code any functions or if I can use a built-in
    command from the API. One of the reasons why I really struggled with the platform detection was because I was attempting to program a function from scratch rather use
    collision detection. This would have made the process much faster and led to added complexity in the long run.

3.  Identify something that you are particularly PROUD of your work in your
    project.  Explain, in a short paragraph, what it is, why you are proud
    of it, and how you will encourage yourself to do it (or its equivalent)
    similarly in future projects.

    Although it's small, I liked the "buffer" feature. This is an effect seen in a lot of video games and is often referred to as a character's "invincibility frames". This obviously
    prevents your character from instantly dying, but also gives you a sense of how long you have to recover before being hit again (via the flashing character). You can edit the
    BUFFER_TIME variable to extend or shorten your recovery. It's more of a quality of life feature rather than one that makes the game run, but this is exactly why I would incorporate
    something similar to other projects in the future.
